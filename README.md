## [Difference Between SX and LX](https://www.versitron.com/products/femm-small-formfactor-pluggable-transceivers-lifetime-warranty-8)  
The **difference between SX and LX** lies in wavelength, fiber type, and transmission distance. SX (Short Wavelength) typically operates at 850 nm over **multimode fiber**, supporting distances up to 550 meters. LX (Long Wavelength) operates at 1310 nm over **singlemode fiber**, with reach up to 10 kilometers. SX is ideal for in-building links; LX is used for long-range outdoor or campus connections.

## [SFP Module Compatibility Guide](https://www.versitron.com/products/gbmm-small-formfactor-pluggable-transceivers-lifetime-warranty-1)  
Versitronâ€™s **SFP module compatibility guide** ensures you match the correct transceiver with your switch, router, or media converter. Key factors include:
- **Data Rate** (100M, 1G, 10G)
- **Connector Type** (LC, SC)
- **Wavelength** (850 nm, 1310 nm, 1550 nm)
- **Fiber Type** (singlemode vs. multimode)
- **DDM Support** (optional diagnostics)
Always confirm device specifications or consult our team for guaranteed interoperability with MSA-compliant modules.

## [Choosing Fiber for Security Cameras](https://www.versitron.com/products/gb10sm-small-formfactor-pluggable-transceivers-lifetime-warranty-3)  
**Choosing fiber for security cameras** depends on distance, environment, and bandwidth needs. For short indoor runs, **multimode fiber with SX transceivers** is often sufficient. For outdoor or remote camera installations, **singlemode fiber with LX or ZX transceivers** provides better range and lower signal loss. Fiber also eliminates EMI, making it ideal for high-security environments like airports, government facilities, and campuses.

## [BiDi vs Duplex SFP](https://www.versitron.com/products/fe2mm-small-formfactor-pluggable-transceivers-lifetime-warranty-9)  
When comparing **BiDi vs duplex SFP**, BiDi (bidirectional) SFPs transmit and receive data on a **single fiber strand** using different wavelengths (e.g., TX1310/RX1550), reducing fiber usage by 50%. Duplex SFPs require **two fiber strands**, one for each direction. BiDi is ideal for fiber-limited installations; duplex offers more traditional compatibility with legacy infrastructure.
